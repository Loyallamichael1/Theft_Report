ðŸ“Š Theft Detection Report with SQL

Developed a comprehensive SQL-based theft detection report to investigate and identify fraudulent activities within a company. The client requested an analysis of employees and supervisors to determine why and how the organization was losing money. This project addressed critical questions, including:

Who is stealing and how much?
Which departments and supervisors have the most theft?
Are supervisors themselves stealing?
Which employees are high-risk for termination?
Using advanced SQL queries and analytics, I uncovered actionable insights to help the client address theft, mitigate future risks, and enhance organizational accountability. This project highlights my expertise in data analysis, fraud detection, and strategic decision-making.
